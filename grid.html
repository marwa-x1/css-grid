   <h1 class="header">The Most Dangerous Flowers </h1>
    <main class="grid-container">
        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item1">
          <img  class="img mr" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/6b/07/6e/6b076ec1de610f26dacac09ad0351002.jpg" alt="Aconitum">
        <h1 class="h1 uppercase it1">Aconitum</h1>
        <p class="p1 text">This flower has several nicknames: the devil’s helmet, wolf’s bane, and the poison queen. It is extremely toxic and may lead to the death of a person.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item2">
          <img  class="img mr" src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/4c/8e/51/4c8e5148fe82ddad88e64bae2fd01719.jpg" alt="bleeding heart">
          <h1 class="h1 uppercase it2">bleeding heart</h1>
          <p class="p2 text">The bright violet petals of the plant attract the attention of many people. Yet, you have to keep your hands off it. The entire vine is poisonous. It’s dangerous for both animals and living-beings.</p>
        </div> 
        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item3">
          <h1 class="h1 uppercase it3">Nerium Oleander</h1>
          <p class="p3">Everyone who meets this blossom wants to pick it. The crimson and creamy petals are appealing and magnificent. However, it’s not worth even breathing its odor. The plant is fully poisonous.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item4">
          <img  class="imgd mr" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/c0/43/d0/c043d065f5377458c8905ce351eb6a79.jpg">
          <h1 class="h1 uppercase it4">Water hemlock</h1>
          <p class="p4">This wildflower is closely related to the above-mentioned hemlock. However, it’s possible to stay alive after consuming it. This deadly blossom grows in North America.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item5">
          <h1 class="h1 uppercase it5">Hemlock</h1>
          <p class="p5">The residents of Europe and North Africa should be aware of this cute blossom. Tender white vines create a misleading impression. Your first desire is to pick the floret. You should do in no way. The plant is one of the most poisonous in the world. There is no antidote for it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item6">
          <img  class="img" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/6d/d6/6f/6dd66ff843fc1dc28942c369d4c538d3.jpg">
          <h1 class="grid-container h1 uppercse it6">Flying Duck Orchid</h1>
          <p class="p6">Luckily, this floret grows only in Australia. It has a weird appearance. The flower itself looks like a real duck. However, the vine is tiny and very dangerous. No matter how strong your desire is to pick it, you shouldn’t do it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item7">
          <img  class="img" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/60/91/7f/60917fc9068a69c99c4663ee43747a64.jpg">
          <h1 class="grid-container h1 uppercase it7">English Broom</h1>
          <p class="p7">The plant is widely spread across England and Europe. The blossom looks like mini bananas. That’s why it’s especially dangerous for the children who want to taste its small buds. Unfortunately, the results of such experiments are fatal. The flower contains chemicals that cause a heart attack.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item8">
          <p class="p8">For more than 5000 years, people have cultivated flowers although there is no known reward for this costly behavior. In three different studies we show that flowers are a powerful positive emotion “inducer”. In Study 1, flowers, upon presentation to women, always elicited the Duchenne or true smile. Women who received flowers reported more positive moods 3 days later.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-container grid-item grid-item9">
          <img  class="img" src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/42/5d/6f/425d6f9295f810d1138f3eba9eaf86fe.jpg">
          <h1 class="grid-container h1 uppercase it9">Angel’s Trumpet</h1>
          <p class="p9">Names are deceptive. The floret has so innocent name but is a ruthless killer indeed. The pink petals are tender but deadly.

            No matter how much you like fauna, it’s not a good idea to pick every new blossom you find</p>
